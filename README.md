# ISeeYou-Ethereum Token Route Mapper
IseeYou, as the title suggests is a ERC20 token route monitoring app, By entering the recipient address and minimum transfer amount for a specific ERC20 token, the app will search for and keep track of any transfers made, it also creates a map and monitors the receiving address as well for a number of iterations you desire.

# 

In order to run it you can either install hardhat and its dependecies and use npx hardhat run  scripts/ISeeYou.js or run it using npm but you will still need to install some dependencies.

You can install dependencies with:

```shell
npm i axios
npm i ethers
npm i etherscan
node "directory"/ISeeYou.js
```
